### Summary

In summary, Timsort consistently outperforms both merge sort and insertion sort, particularly on larger arrays. Insertion sort, while acceptable for small arrays, becomes inefficient as array size increases. The results showed that Timsort, which combines `O(n log n)` merge sort with `O(nÂ²)` insertion sort for small data segments, is much more efficient in practice. This efficiency comes from using insertion sort on smaller, nearly sorted subarrays and merge sort on larger unsorted portions, optimizing the overall performance to approximately `O(n log n)` in most real-world cases. This hybrid approach makes Timsort significantly faster than using either algorithm alone, particularly on partially sorted or real-world data.
